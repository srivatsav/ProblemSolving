/**
 * You are given equations in the format A / B = k, where A and B are variables
 * represented as strings, and k is a real number (floating-point number). Given
 * some queries, return the answers. If the answer does not exist, return -1.0.
 * 
 * The input is always valid. You may assume that evaluating the queries will
 * result in no division by zero and there is no contradiction.
 * 
 * Input: equations = [["a","b"],["b","c"]], values = [2.0,3.0], queries =
 * [["a","c"],["b","a"],["a","e"],["a","a"],["x","x"]] Output:
 * [6.00000,0.50000,-1.00000,1.00000,-1.00000]
 * 
 * Explanation: Given: a / b = 2.0, b / c = 3.0 queries are: a / c = ?, b / a =
 * ?, a / e = ?, a / a = ?, x / x = ? return: [6.0, 0.5, -1.0, 1.0, -1.0 ]
